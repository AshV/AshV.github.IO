The kids are viewed from an horizontal angle in the next scene as they go through a playground-like structure. Finn and Jake are examining the &lsquo;Catapilla Family&rsquo;. After watching Princess Bubblegum teach the children about the Food Chain, they head to the snack bar as Finn found Princess Bubblegum&rsquo;s class useless.</p></p>

Upon arrival, the Guardian attaches The Lich&rsquo;s crystal prison onto a much larger crystal &ldquo;cell block.&rdquo; Finn then says it is a good riddance for The Lich. As they talk, The Lich begins emitting a gray breath in his cell which the duo don&rsquo;t notice. Finn and Jake then look around for Finn&rsquo;s long-lost father, whom Finn initially suggests might be a Guardian. Jake points out a strange looking &ldquo;old kid&rdquo; who resembles Finn, and it turns out to be Finn&rsquo;s father incarcerated inside a crystal jail cell.</p></p>
