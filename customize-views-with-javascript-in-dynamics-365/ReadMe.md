# Customize Views with Javascript in Dynamics 365

Dynamics 365 v9.0 onwards JavaScript is not only limited to Forms, you can even customize views. More specifically you can just add icon in cells as of now, I was expecting more features but it didn’t have.

I’ll be doing all the customizations in *All Cases* view of *Case* entity. So you can try it right away in new trial instance without creating any custom entity/view.

### 1. Add one JS web resource
