# State Design Pattern by Example

This pattern is one of the object oriented way to implement *[Finite State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)*.
When in our software object can transit between multiple possible states, and changes it's behaviour accoring to state. Then this type of problem can be solve with the help of *Finite State Machines*.
State Pattern falls under *Behavioral Design Patterns*.
