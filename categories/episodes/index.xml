      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with candy children that have bodies resembling different shapes sliding down a slide, shouting with excitement. The kids are viewed from an horizontal angle in the next scene as they go through a playground-like structure. Finn and Jake are examining the &amp;lsquo;Catapilla Family&amp;rsquo;. After watching Princess Bubblegum teach the children about the Food Chain, they head to the snack bar as Finn found Princess Bubblegum&amp;rsquo;s class useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they&amp;rsquo;re walking Magic Man appears behind the two without them knowing, and transforms them into birds. After singing an electronic version of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Der_H%C3%B6lle_Rache_kocht_in_meinem_Herzen&#34;&gt;Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; they fly down below to a place with an oasis on it. Jake eats some caterpillars, which disgusts Finn. After that Finn tries eating the caterpillars and pukes on the ground. In the next scene, Finn and Jake are shown to be very chubby and sitting on the ground lazily. Finn becomes confused for why he became full from eating few caterpillars. Jake informs him that they have been eating for hours. Soon, Finn and Jake notice a shadow on the ground that gradually becomes bigger. They look up to see a big bird trying to attack them. Finn and Jake dodge this attack and attempt to fly away. However, because of Finn&amp;rsquo;s chubby body, Finn is not able to fly and skids across the ground. As the big bird flies closer, Finn cowers. The big bird does not recognize Finn and flies onward. As Finn tries to fly away, the big bird notices and flies towards him once again. Just as the big bird was close enough to strike, Magic Man converts Finn into the big bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then flies next to Jake. Jake does not recognize him, stating him as big and old. Finn hallucinates Jake as meat. Finn drools awfully, and states that Jake looks awesome and tasty. Finn asks Jake if he wants to go inside his mouth. Jake accepts and sits in his mouth. He states that Finn has a lot of saliva. Finn tries to eat Jake before he could escape from Finn&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Finn attempts again to eat him. Finn elevates lower until he hits the ground. He lays on the ground while the sun sets, stating how hungry he is, and dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Finn is turned into hundreds of bacteria. The bacteria notices the dead body of the big bird as food and eats it. Jake is also turned into a bacterium and states that Finn eating the big bird is disgusting. The bacteria becomes full after the big bird results as a skeleton. The bacteria is then swept away by a gust of wind. Finn and Jake then find themselves turned into flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake sing &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/We%27re_Plants&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re Plants&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; during the song, caterpillars eat Finn and Jake&amp;rsquo;s leaves. Small birds come to eat the caterpillars. Finn and Jake are then turned into caterpillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake spot &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Erin&#34;&gt;Erin&lt;/a&gt; who faints from the heat. Finn crawls to Erin quickly, madly in love with her. Finn and Jake crawl with her in search of an oasis. Erin faints again, and Jake finds an oasis. Finn, Erin, and Jake eat the leaves in the oasis. After a short discussion, Erin and Finn decide to get married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes into a leaf with a group of caterpillars with Jake hosting the marriage. Finn agrees to the marriage and everyone cheers. Suddenly, two birds are shown flying to the leaf, eating the caterpillars. Finn and Jake then changes into the birds eating the caterpillars until Finn was back into reality. Finn had caterpillars stuffed in his mouth in which he spitted them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back into the reality, Finn realizes the lesson of the Food Chain and sings &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Food_Chain_(song)&#34;&gt;Food Chain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which PB soon joins singing with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end shows Finn transforming into a bird-caterpillar-plant-bacteria hybrid while the kids leave due to boredom, once again entering the slide seen in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sad Face (Season 6)</title>
      <link>http://example.com/posts/season-6-sad-face/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Neptr&#34;&gt;Neptr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/BMO&#34;&gt;BMO&lt;/a&gt; spying on a sleeping Finn and Jake. Neptr asks BMO what is going to happen and asks the cause of their spying to which BMO tells him to just watch, as this happens once in a month and also promises it would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to Jake and suddenly, his tail starts to wiggle. BMO points out this is what he called Neptr for, and they observe as Jake&amp;rsquo;s tail starts to move. Neptr is fascinated by it, and they follow Jake&amp;rsquo;s tail and spy on it. They sneak with the tail in the living room, and find that the tail has got a hat on his head. It further moves to get a cloth and packs some berries in it, and goes out of the treehouse. Neptr asks that where does the tail go, to which BMO replies it is none of their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tail passes under a horse and through a bush to reach a tiny circus. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Ringmaster&#34;&gt;Ringmaster&lt;/a&gt; notices him, and refers to him as Blue Nose, hinting the tail must have worked for quite a time. He tells Blue Nose that he is late, and tells him to put on his makeup. Blue Nose obeys him and goes to a makeup room. The scene changes to inside the circus, where a blind grasshopper is throwing knives at a target at which another ant is tied on. The crowd is fascinated as a knife pierces the target just near the ant. Blue Nose is shown in the makeup room applying a white substance at the lower end, and painting a &amp;lsquo;blue nose&amp;rsquo;, and a sad face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene again is changed at the circus and this time, the waving &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Snail&#34;&gt;Snail&lt;/a&gt; is performing a jump in a water pot, in which it succeeded and the crowd cheers. The snail exits, and a poor quality music starts playing. Blue Nose enters the arena with a cart of oranges and shows an act of taking an orange and rolling it in ground. The crowd observes it without any expression. Blue Nose finds a puppet bee in the cart, and wakes it up. It wakes up, and Blue Nose puts him on the ground. They both dance for a moment, then suddenly the bee dies and is taken off stage. Due to this boring act, the crowd criticizes Blue Nose, however, there is one little ant which is seen touched by the act and crying, although nobody notices her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd throws various things at Blue Nose for an unimpressive act and Blue Nose exits from the arena. The Ringmaster is also bored by it and further criticizes Blue Nose. The Ringmaster then enters and announces an upcoming of a fierce performance and says it is about a dangerous beast in captivity. He announces the appearance of a chipmunk named Goralina, who is led by six ants and is in chains. They take Goralina on a raised platform and make it sit there. Blue Nose starts to see this, and sees the Ringmaster cruelly beating the chipmunk to perform for him. An audience throws an empty bottle of bug milk on its eye, to which she becomes enraged and breaks out of the chains and starts attacking the Ringmaster. She takes almost all of the crowd in its mouth. Blue Nose comes with a movable staircase and reaches near Goralina. He starts to hypnotize the chipmunk and succeeds. The grasshopper from an earlier act comes and throws the knife at Goralina. The chipmunk gets hypnotized and throws out the crowd she engulfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene then fades out to the place of the Ringmaster. He is seen trying to put a 5 cent coin in a small box. Blue Nose approaches and the Ringmaster welcomes him. He talks about the show going completely wrong. He says that Goralina had given him a good amount of money the last show and is disappointed that no one rivaled Goralina today. He says there is another show in an hour and says to come up with an interesting act that will rival to the performance of her. Blue Nose is saddened by the fact that the chipmunk is kept there without her will, and goes to the cage of Goralina. He sees a sign indicating not to feed the monster. He rips it off and offers the berries he bought which she eats. Then he thinks about his next show and goes to his equipment chest. He sees a whoopee cushion and takes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene fades to the arena and shows Blue Nose entering. He starts his same song used in the last show, and the Ringmaster thinks he will still perform the same bad act. Blue Nose instead goes to the middle, where there is a chair with a cushion on it. As soon as he sat on the cushion, it made a farting sound, to which the crowd laughed. The Ringmaster is awestruck and sees as the act continues. Blue Nose takes the whoopee cushion and throws it, and then proceeds to sit, but the chair breaks and the crowd laughs. He then goes to fill his water tumbler, but the water container throws water at his face. He starts to wrestle with it, but it kept throwing out water and the crowd laughed at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then proceeds to change his music to more hip type, but the record player doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this and he breaks it and the crowd laughs yet again. After his act, the crowd starts throwing money at him and Blue Nose approaches the Ringmaster. He is quite pleased with Blue Nose and says if he and Goralina perform, they would make this show a success. Blue Nose gets angered by him, and proceeds to use a whip on him. Thinking that it was part of an act, the audience cheers, laughs, and applauds. Goralina is arrived in chains but Blue Nose helps her to break out and they start running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are escaped from the circus, but due to the fact that Blue Nose is Jake&amp;rsquo;s tail and was just stretching, its trails were still in the circus, and so the Ringmaster pulls him back. He starts to slap him and one of the ants who was slapping him smeared his hat on his mouth, which changes expression from sad to that of happy. They ask him why is he happy, but he just waits and as soon as the first ray of sunlight strikes him, he begins to undo all his stretching, and finally reaches Jake, who wakes with a snap. Finn notices Jake and says nothing as he does not know it, but the episode ends with Neptr and BMO giggling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Escape from the Citadel (Season 6)</title>
      <link>http://example.com/posts/season-6-escape-the-citadel/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn&#34;&gt;Finn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; hitch a ride on a Citadel Guardian after he imprisons and transports &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lich_(character)&#34;&gt;The Lich&lt;/a&gt; to the Citadel. Upon arrival, the Guardian attaches The Lich&amp;rsquo;s crystal prison onto a much larger crystal &amp;ldquo;cell block.&amp;rdquo; Finn then says it is a good riddance for The Lich. As they talk, The Lich begins emitting a gray breath in his cell which the duo don&amp;rsquo;t notice. Finn and Jake then look around for Finn&amp;rsquo;s long-lost father, whom Finn initially suggests might be a Guardian. Jake points out a strange looking &amp;ldquo;old kid&amp;rdquo; who resembles Finn, and it turns out to be Finn&amp;rsquo;s father incarcerated inside a crystal jail cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn runs to his dad and looks him closely. A gray slime fire forms on Finn&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s cell, which makes Finn hyper about it and asks Jake about the fire. Jake then points above from where the fire had fallen on the cell. They then notice that the Lich&amp;rsquo;s cell is excreting a gray slime that is beginning to infect the other prisoners and making them under the influence of The Lich. The cell of Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then melts and his father half inside the cell asks Finn for help. Finn uses Jake as flail to break him out of the cell. The Lich&amp;rsquo;s influence over the Citadel enables a massive jailbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then asks him about the &amp;ldquo;starskipper&amp;rdquo; from which they came, completely ignoring the fact that there is another human in his presence. The prisoners are running amok and attacking the Guardians and making each other gray. After Jake says that Finn is his son, Finn&amp;rsquo;s father is still not surprised by it and starts telling them to find a way to escape. Finn starts to ask his father why he abandoned him, but before he could do, his father jumps in the center of the Citadel, as the ground was melting. Finn again begins to ask him but is cut in middle as a dead guardian pushes them even further. They reach a solid ground and Jake gets frightened by the happenings around him. One of the prisoners is a void caster, who has the power to open portals, so he uses his power to attack a guardian by opening a void in front of a train that &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Starchie&#34;&gt;Starchie&lt;/a&gt; is driving in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom&#34;&gt;Candy Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, which crashes into a guardian and kills the guardian. Finn calms Jake down and says to just hijack a floating piece of the Citadel some other Ancients were hijacking and go off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then tells Jake to smarten up and as he was saying, the last Guardian who was dying shoots a beam that hits Finn&amp;rsquo;s father in the lower right shin, which obliterates all the flesh from a segment of his leg, leaving the bones. Finn starts to panic but his father, who introduces him as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Martin&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; says that the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s blood has healing properties, and asks Finn to bring it. Finn but puts his question why he was abandoned in the woods, which Martin doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember. He just tells Finn to bring the blood of guardian first. Jake shape-shifts himself into a bridge, enabling Finn to retrieve the regenerative guardian blood and put it on Martin&amp;rsquo;s leg, which is quickly restored to a healthy state. While this is happening, Jake points out to Finn that the Lich came out of the swamp. Finn calls for Martin, who had fled with the other prisoners, abandoning Finn once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cell of The Lich bursts and he commands Finn and Jake to fall, which makes them go unconscious. The Lich then entrances Finn, telling him that there is only darkness in his life and only death will be imminent for all life and that he is all alone in the world now. Jake appears unconscious next to Finn. Finn feebly attempts to strike the Lich as he encroaches. His attack was ineffective, but there was some guardian blood near him. The Lich approaches for Finn and as soon as he was to touch, Finn&amp;rsquo;s hand, which was dipped in some guardian blood near him touched the Lich which causes the Lich to scream as flesh begins to grows on his bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then wakes from his trance and throws more guardian blood onto The Lich, restoring more flesh around his chest. Finn then tells Jake to finish him off while he chases after his father. Martin goes to the other prisoners and persuades them to make him their leader, to which they agree. He makes a creature to cut the stem before Finn reaches him. But as soon as the creature cuts the stem, Finn holds the cut end of the stem from both sides. This causes Martin to panic and at Martin&amp;rsquo;s request, the fugitive void caster creates a void to escape into, which begins to suck the floating chunk of land upward faster. Finn grabs the two halves of the severed stem tighter and preventing his father from leaving, telling he won&amp;rsquo;t let him escape and he struggles to hold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake tells Finn to let it go, calling Martin a loser but Finn refuses and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Grass_Sword&#34;&gt;Grass Sword&lt;/a&gt; takes over Finn&amp;rsquo;s right arm, allowing him one last tremendous pull. Martin grosses out at this and asks the void caster to enlarge the void. This causes much pressure on Finn&amp;rsquo;s hand and at last, Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm gives out and is severed from his body, while Martin states &amp;ldquo;Wait, what about air—&amp;rdquo; right before escaping through the portal. Finn falls into the water below where a small piece of Guardian blood touches his arm, making the stump of an arm sprout a flower. Jake pulls Finn to shore where &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Shelby&#34;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to have been hiding out the entire time. Shelby then sits on Finn&amp;rsquo;s lap while crying. Finn is reminded of the Lich and asks Jake if he finished him off. Jake says there&amp;rsquo;s no need, as the Guardian blood transformed the Lich into a baby-like creature, who is seemingly cute and harmless. Finn, Jake, Shelby, and the infant Lich return to the Candy Kingdom by way of the portal that Starchie drove through during the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)&#34;&gt;Tree Trunks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Pig&#34;&gt;Mr. Pig&lt;/a&gt; are sitting in her house when outside Finn and Jake&amp;rsquo;s chatter can be heard. The doorbell rings, interrupting a somber Tree Trunks saying, &amp;ldquo;I think we should get a d—.&amp;rdquo; The couple sees outside their door an infant Lich in a stereotypical abandoned-baby basket. Tree Trunks looks excited and implies that this sudden addition to their family has changed her feeling about whatever she was about to say. The infant Lich suddenly says, &amp;ldquo;Hello!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
