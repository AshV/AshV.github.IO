# Easy Blogging for Lazy Programmers

When I started web programming almost 10 years back, no one would have thought that people will go crazy some day to make their websites static. Back then it was PHP and Wordpress era even if your website is almost static ```include 'header.php'``` was always there to run at server for obvoius reasons. 

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) is still most popular [open source CMS](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) today, and heaven for non tech bloggers to get started quickly.

In last few years static site generators have gained popularity for various reasons (see here [7 reasons to use static site generator](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-reasons-use-static-site-generator/)).

Now, if you are a techie and planning to starts writing, so it dosen't suits you to go with traditional CMS approches. There's a huge list of awesome static site generators at [StaticGen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/). You can compare and choose according to your requirements. You can set them up in your machine and get started, it will take hardly 30 minutes, and then write your post,  then build, it will generate your static site, then push it to your server.

WAIT A MINUTE..... Title of this article says something EAZY , LAZY , PROGRAMMERS ???

Alright! but  lemme make you clear If you are not a Programmer(coz it uses GitHub) and don't like to delay the mess to latest way possible(i.e Lazy), Then this post is not for you, happily setup *Wordpress* or write in *Medium*.

**This may not be best way, I am just sharing because this is how I have done.**

## Reasons I use GitHub Pages

* No extra setup, It's just a GitHub repo.
* Can use my own domain without extra cost.
* I don't need  to open any other editor, I can use Visual Studio, thanks to awesome VS extension by [Name]
* I can correct typos online or even can write full articles.
* No formatting headaches, it's markdown.
* It dosen't stops me from using HTML, if I wish to.
* Full control over website theme and appearance
* Seggregate content over multiple repos.
* No ads like wordpress.com hosting.
