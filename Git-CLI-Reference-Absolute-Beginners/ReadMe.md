Git is a distributed version control system, developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 2005 and currently maintained by [Junio C Hamano](https://github.com/gitster). There are many popular GUI tools and extensions are available to use git, but originally git was developed as command line tool, it is still fun to use git using command line, you will also understand under the hood magic done by GUI tools.

If you ever had your project copies likes above image, definitely you need a Version Control System. Version Control Systems maintains version of files without creating multiple copies, you need to commit the changes to store versions, you can go travel back and forth in commit history and get your files at any desired point of time. Now you can relate why I used the word "Time Travel".

Git is not the only version control system, there are many, you can see a comparison in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software), There are many online services which provide git services, popular ones are [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) & [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)(Yes, they do provide git, along with VSTS)

But you don't actually need any one of them, to try out **Git**, because it is not just a Version Control System, it is a **Distributed Version Control System**, which plays major role in popularity of Git.
