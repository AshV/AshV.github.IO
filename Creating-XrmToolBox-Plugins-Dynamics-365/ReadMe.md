# How To Create Your Own XrmToolBox Plugins 

[XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com) has plenty of useful plugins, and awesome people like you from community keep adding new plugins to solve Dynamics 365 developer's day to day hurdles and make them more productive.

Recently I was working on a XrmToolBox plugin (have a look on GitHub [Dynamics 365 Bulk Solution Exporter](https://github.com/AshV/Dynamics365BulkSolutionExporter/)). I thought of sharing my learning experience. I would like to thanks [Santish Bhagat](https://github.com/santoshCRM) who has already devloped many solutions for the Dynamics Community, has helped me in connection related issues, and [Shabbir Hussain](https://www.facebook.com/shabbir.WinSoft) who is young and energetic coder, has helped me in Windows Forms related stuff.

XrmToolBox is basically a class library, you can create your plugin in 2 ways.

1. Start by taking a class library project and installing [XrmToolBoxPackage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XrmToolBoxPackage/) using nuget. You need to create one Custom Windows Form Control in this approach. I created [Dynamics 365 Bulk Solution Exporter](https://github.com/AshV/Dynamics365BulkSolutionExporter/) in this way, because tempalte was not available back then.

2. Tanguy Touzard (Creator of XrmToolBox) has simplifed the process by creating **XrmToolBox Plugin Project Template for Visual Studio**, which configures most of the things automatically. This is preferred way of creating plugins now.

### Start Project with XrmToolBox Plugin Project Template

You won't be getting this project template by default in Visual Studio, to install goto new project dialog, navigate to `online` section in left pane and search for `XrmToolBox` in right pane, template will appear in result. install it, Visual Studio need to be restarted in order to install the template.

After installing, create new Project using this template. Framework version should be selected as 4.6.2.

### Components of Project

You will get 2 main files in newly created project where you need to work on.

#### 1. MyPlugin.cs

This file conatains metadata like name of the plugin, icons and color etc, which you can change according to purpose of your plugin. I am leaving this as it is for now.

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using XrmToolBox.Extensibility;
using XrmToolBox.Extensibility.Interfaces;

namespace XrmToolBox.WhoAmIPlugin
{
    // Do not forget to update version number and author (company attribute) in AssemblyInfo.cs class
    // To generate Base64 string for Images below, you can use https://www.base64-image.de/
    [Export(typeof(IXrmToolBoxPlugin)),
        ExportMetadata("Name", "My First Plugin"),
        ExportMetadata("Description", "This is a description for my first plugin"),
        // Please specify the base64 content of a 32x32 pixels image
        ExportMetadata("SmallImageBase64", null),
        // Please specify the base64 content of a 80x80 pixels image
        ExportMetadata("BigImageBase64", null),
        ExportMetadata("BackgroundColor", "Lavender"),
        ExportMetadata("PrimaryFontColor", "Black"),
        ExportMetadata("SecondaryFontColor", "Gray")]
    public class MyPlugin : PluginBase
    {
        public override IXrmToolBoxPluginControl GetControl()
        {
            return new MyPluginControl();
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Settings.cs

This file help you to save/update any configuration value permanently, which will be available when you next time open the tool. How to save and retrieve, we will see further.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace XrmToolBox.WhoAmIPlugin
{
    /// <summary>
    /// This class can help you to store settings for your plugin
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class must be XML serializable
    /// </remarks>
    public class Settings
    {
        public string LastUsedOrganizationWebappUrl { get; set; }
    }
}
```

#### 3. MyPluginControl.cs

This is a Windows Form Control which is composed of 3 files.
 1. **MyPluginControl.cs[Design]** : This files contains the UI where we can pull the controls from Toolbox and make the Plugin UI what user will interact with.
 2. **MyPluginControl.designer.cs** : This files contains autogenerated code, which is generated while we are placing and configuring controls in UI using drag & drop. we don't need to directly interact with this file.
 3. **MyPluginControl.cs** : This is where we need bind our logic to different events generated from UI, like ButtonClick, OnLoad etc. This file is shown below, is contains some sample code which retrieves count of Account records and displays to user.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Data;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using XrmToolBox.Extensibility;
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Query;
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
using McTools.Xrm.Connection;

namespace XrmToolBox.WhoAmIPlugin
{
    public partial class MyPluginControl : PluginControlBase
    {
        private Settings mySettings;

        public MyPluginControl()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void MyPluginControl_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            ShowInfoNotification("This is a notification that can lead to XrmToolBox repository", new Uri("https://github.com/MscrmTools/XrmToolBox"));

            // Loads or creates the settings for the plugin
            if (!SettingsManager.Instance.TryLoad(GetType(), out mySettings))
            {
                mySettings = new Settings();

                LogWarning("Settings not found => a new settings file has been created!");
            }
            else
            {
                LogInfo("Settings found and loaded");
            }
        }

        private void tsbClose_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            CloseTool();
        }

        private void tsbSample_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // The ExecuteMethod method handles connecting to an
            // organization if XrmToolBox is not yet connected
            ExecuteMethod(GetAccounts);
        }

        private void GetAccounts()
        {
            WorkAsync(new WorkAsyncInfo
            {
                Message = "Getting accounts",
                Work = (worker, args) =>
                {
                    args.Result = Service.RetrieveMultiple(new QueryExpression("account")
                    {
                        TopCount = 50
                    });
                },
                PostWorkCallBack = (args) =>
                {
                    if (args.Error != null)
                    {
                        MessageBox.Show(args.Error.ToString(), "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
                    }
                    var result = args.Result as EntityCollection;
                    if (result != null)
                    {
                        MessageBox.Show($"Found {result.Entities.Count} accounts");
                    }
                }
            });
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// This event occurs when the plugin is closed
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="sender"></param>
        /// <param name="e"></param>
        private void MyPluginControl_OnCloseTool(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Before leaving, save the settings
            SettingsManager.Instance.Save(GetType(), mySettings);
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// This event occurs when the connection has been updated in XrmToolBox
        /// </summary>
        public override void UpdateConnection(IOrganizationService newService, ConnectionDetail detail, string actionName, object parameter)
        {
            base.UpdateConnection(newService, detail, actionName, parameter);

            mySettings.LastUsedOrganizationWebappUrl = detail.WebApplicationUrl;
            LogInfo("Connection has changed to: {0}", detail.WebApplicationUrl);
        }
    }
}
```

This file has few other examples too like ShowInfoNotification(), LogWarning() & UpdateConnection() etc. for a complete list of available methods you can check **PluginContolBase** class from which this is inherited to.

### Understanding the Framework

Here in this sample we will me making WhoAmIRequest and will be showing response to user. Before that you should have a look at GetAccounts() that how it is written.

In XrmToolBox plugins all requests to server should be made **asynchronously** but here is a twist, we won't be using async & await, instead **WorkAsync(WorkAsyncInfo info)** is provided in **XrmToolBox.Extensibility** namespace, Let's look into **WorkAsyncInfo** class of framework which is main class to execute code of any plugin.

```csharp
using System;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace XrmToolBox.Extensibility
{
    public class WorkAsyncInfo
    {
        public WorkAsyncInfo();
        public WorkAsyncInfo(string message, Action<DoWorkEventArgs> work);
        public WorkAsyncInfo(string message, Action<BackgroundWorker, DoWorkEventArgs> work);

        public object AsyncArgument { get; set; }
        public Control Host { get; set; }
        public bool IsCancelable { get; set; }
        public string Message { get; set; }
        public int MessageHeight { get; set; }
        public int MessageWidth { get; set; }
        public Action<RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs> PostWorkCallBack { get; set; }
        public Action<ProgressChangedEventArgs> ProgressChanged { get; set; }
        public Action<BackgroundWorker, DoWorkEventArgs> Work { get; set; }
    }
}
```

You can look into constructors and properties yourself, let me talk about callbacks available here.
